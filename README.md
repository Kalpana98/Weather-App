# Weather-App :blush:

### Significant Technologies used -:
It is a Web Application that I've created using Django Framework for discovering the current weather of any valid city in the entire world. 
I've made use of API taken from the [OpenWeatherMap!](https://openweathermap.org) to access the live weather details.
I've used [Bulma!](https://bulma.io/) Framework for the css layout rather than Bootstrap or any other technology. It made my work really easy and attractive.

### About the App -:
I have two sides of the WebApp. One is the Client side where a user can type in the name of any city and that city will be displayed below with it's current temperature in Celsius. He/She can also remove a particular city by clicking on the little cross sign that I've appended on top-right corner. The other one is the Admin side wherein the Admin can login and access & update all functionalities.
